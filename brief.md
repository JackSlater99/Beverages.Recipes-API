# Capstone Project Domain.net 
## Brief
Create a restful API from scratch using Java Spring and implement in a front end web application using React which will allow the users to view the formatted data and get access to the open API for their own usage.
### MVP
For the MVP the user should be able to:
- See a list of drinks recipe's on a responsive front end.
- Allow users to access the API for personal use.
- Filter the API results based on user requirements.
- Have a reasonably sized data set (50+).
- Deploy on a Cloud service.
### Extensions
- Allow users to leave reviews on recipes.
- Implement search function to find recipes.
- Utilise a country data API to provide basic information on country a drink originates from.

Use the following frameworks / libraries:
- Stripe (for donations to help with server costs).
- Auth0 for securing Admin functions.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Implement Web Advertisements.
